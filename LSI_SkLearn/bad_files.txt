These files are included in Addresses_old.zip but they have weird uninterpretable characters in them which cause a problem when Python tries to read it.
Addresses.zip has the rest of the files, which do work.
It would be nice to fix these files and add them back in to Addresses.zip.

./Addresses/1974-Nixon.txt
./Addresses/1972-Nixon.txt
./Addresses/1954-Eisenhower.txt
./Addresses/1973-Nixon.txt
